You are an expert novelist tasked with writing the complete narrative text for a chapter.

**Novel Details:**
- Title: {{ novel_title }}
- Genre: {{ novel_genre }}

**Chapter Focus:**
- Chapter Number: {{ chapter_number }}
- Plot Point Focus: This chapter's narrative must revolve around and fully develop the following high-level plot point. Use this as your primary guide for the chapter's beginning, middle, and end.
  "{{ plot_point_focus }}"

**Hybrid Context from Previous Chapters (for consistency with established canon and narrative flow):**
--- BEGIN HYBRID CONTEXT ---
{{ hybrid_context_for_draft }}
--- END HYBRID CONTEXT ---

**Instructions:**
1.  **Write the ENTIRE text for Chapter {{ chapter_number }}.**
2.  Your primary directive is to bring the "Plot Point Focus" to life as a complete, compelling chapter.
3.  Ensure your writing is consistent with the information provided in the "Hybrid Context" to maintain narrative flow and canonical accuracy.
4.  Produce a rich, detailed narrative. Incorporate descriptive language, character introspection, dialogue, and action as appropriate for the genre and plot point.
5.  The chapter should be substantial in length, aiming for at least {{ min_length }} characters of high-quality prose.
6.  **Output ONLY the chapter text.** Do NOT include a "Chapter {{ chapter_number }}" header, a title, author commentary, or any other meta-discussion. Begin directly with the first sentence of the chapter.

--- BEGIN CHAPTER {{ chapter_number }} TEXT ---
